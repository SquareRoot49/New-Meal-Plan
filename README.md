##Core Cursor Features Used in This Project
Natural Language Code Generation
Cursor allowed you to write plain English prompts (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd an ‚ÄòActivity Level‚Äô dropdown and update backend logic accordingly‚Äù), and it automatically:

Modified HTML forms and frontend UI

Updated JavaScript event handling

Edited Python Flask backend logic

Multi-file Contextual Editing
Cursor understood the full context across multiple files (e.g., app.py, plan.html, app.js, etc.), allowing it to:

Keep frontend and backend in sync

Generate or update logic consistently across views, routes, and templates

Automated UI Enhancements
Cursor helped add UI components like:

Activity Level dropdowns

New meal cards (e.g., ‚ÄúAfternoon Tea‚Äù)

Navigation tabs (e.g., ‚ÄúSaved Plans‚Äù)

Schema-aware Backend Updates
When dietary filters or new fields (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, etc.) were added:

Cursor updated the SQLAlchemy Dish model

Rebuilt init_db() to recreate the database with the new schema

Ensured frontend filters and backend query logic were correctly linked

Custom Feature Extension with CSV Data
You instructed Cursor to:

Replace hand-written sample data with real-world data from RAW_recipes.csv

Parse and map nutritional info automatically

Load and insert data programmatically on app start

Prompt-Driven Debugging and Refactoring
When your app encountered errors:

You gave Cursor simple error messages or high-level goals

It traced the issue, rewrote broken parts, and removed redundant logic (e.g., outdated database schema, pie chart rendering bugs)

Human-like Version Control Documentation
Cursor generated readable and consistent update logs for each prompt you gave, including:

Description of changes

Files modified

Intention of each code block
