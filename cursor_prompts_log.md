**Description of Change:**

## Prompt 2 – 2025-06-30

**Prompt:**  
Right now, each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) only shows one item. I want to improve this by allowing each meal to include 2–3 dishes. Each dish should have its own calories, protein, carbs, and fat. The total nutritional value of each meal should be shown as the sum of its dishes. Please update the code accordingly.

**Files Modified:**  
- app.py  
- templates/plan.html  
- (possibly data source or helper functions, if any)

**Description of Change:**  
- Updated the meal data structure to support multiple dishes per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), each with its own nutritional values  
- Aggregated the total calories, protein, carbs, and fat for each meal from its dishes  
- Modified the HTML layout of `plan.html` to:
  - Display total nutritional values at the top of each meal card  
  - List 2–3 dishes per meal, each showing its own nutrition  
- Updated logic to ensure the top-level daily totals reflect the sum of all dishes across all meals
