## Prompt 1 – 2025-06-30

**Prompt:**  
I’m learning to build websites with Python, and I want to create a site that helps people plan their daily meals based on their desired calorie intake. Help me design this website.

**Files Modified:**  
- app.py  
- templates/index.html  
- templates/plan.html  
- static/css/style.css  

**Description of Change:**  
Set up the initial Flask web app structure:
- Created `app.py` to define the Flask server
- Added route `/` to render a homepage with a form for users to input target calorie intake
- Added basic HTML templates for home and meal plan display
- Linked a simple CSS file for basic styling

## Prompt 2 – 2025-06-30

**Prompt:**  
Right now, each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) only shows one item. I want to improve this by allowing each meal to include 2–3 dishes. Each dish should have its own calories, protein, carbs, and fat. The total nutritional value of each meal should be shown as the sum of its dishes. Please update the code accordingly.

**Files Modified:**  
- app.py  
- templates/plan.html  
- (possibly data source or helper functions, if any)

**Description of Change:**  
- Updated the meal data structure to support multiple dishes per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), each with its own nutritional values  
- Aggregated the total calories, protein, carbs, and fat for each meal from its dishes  
- Modified the HTML layout of `plan.html` to:
  - Display total nutritional values at the top of each meal card  
  - List 2–3 dishes per meal, each showing its own nutrition  
- Updated logic to ensure the top-level daily totals reflect the sum of all dishes across all meals

## Prompt 3 – 2025-06-30

**Prompt:**  
For each meal section (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), I want to add a pie chart that shows the calorie distribution across its dishes. Each chart should display the proportion of calories from each dish in that meal.

**Files Modified:**  
- templates/plan.html  
- static/js/app.js  
- static/css/style.css  
- (possibly app.py or the backend if any changes were made to pass dish-level calorie data to the frontend)

**Description of Change:**  
- Added a pie chart to each meal card (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) showing the calorie distribution across its individual dishes
- Used Chart.js (or a similar JS charting library) to render the charts in the frontend
- Updated `plan.html` to include canvas elements for each chart
- Enhanced `app.js` to dynamically populate the calorie values for each chart based on the meal data
- Adjusted layout and styles in `style.css` to position the charts cleanly within each card
